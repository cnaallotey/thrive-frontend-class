        <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the grill to medium. Place the sardines and tuna steak on the grill rack and grill for 10 - 15
            minutes, turning halfway through the cooking time. Leave to cool, then chill in the fridge before adding to
            the salad. </li>
        <li>Place the lettuce, tomatoes and onions in a large bowl, then add the green beans, peas, cannellini beans and
            smoked salmon. </li>
        <li>Flake the grilled tuna and add to the salad, season with the sea salt and black pepper and mix together
            carefully. Add the grilled sardines and garnish with the soft-boiled egg quarters. Cover and chill before
            serving. When ready to serve, dress with salad cream or mayonnaise to taste and serve with warm toasted
            baguette, ciabatta or hard dough bread. </li>
    </ol>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Tips:</strong> I used to drown my Ghana Salad in salad cream – guilty pleasures – but if you want a
        healthier option, make a vinaigrette of 3 parts olive oil to 1 part balsamic vinegar and season with sea salt
        and black pepper, then add to the salad before serving. Hard dough bread (also known as '<i>butter bread</i>')
        is a white loaf that is slightly sweet. It can be bought sliced or unsliced.
